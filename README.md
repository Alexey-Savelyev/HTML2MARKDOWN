# Meet ReverseMarkdown [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/xse0bia9olr5shxr?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/BabuAnnamalai/reversemarkdown-net)

ReverseMarkdown is a Html to Markdown (http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) converter library in C#. Conversion is very reliable since HtmlAgilityPack (HAP) library is used for traversing the Html DOM.

var converter = new ReverseMarkdown.Converter();

string html = "This a sample <strong>paragraph</strong> from <a href=""http://test.com"">my site</a>";

string result = converter.Convert(html);

//result This a sample **paragraph** from [my site](http://test.com)
```

```csharp
// with config
string unknownTagsConverter = "pass_through";
bool githubFlavored = true;
var config = new ReverMarkdown.Config(unknownTagsConverter, githubFlavoured);
var converter = new ReverseMarkdown.Converter(config);
```
