# Meet ReverseMarkdown

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/xse0bia9olr5shxr?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/BabuAnnamalai/reversemarkdown-net) [![NuGet Version](http://img.shields.io/nuget/v/ReverseMarkdown.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ReverseMarkdown/) [![NuGet Pre-release Version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/ReverseMarkdown.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ReverseMarkdown/1.0.0-beta1)

ReverseMarkdown is a Html to Markdown (http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) converter library in C#. Conversion is very reliable since HtmlAgilityPack (HAP) library is used for traversing the Html DOM.

Note that the library implementation is based on the Ruby based Html to Markdown converter [ xijo/reverse_markdown](https://github.com/xijo/reverse_markdown).

> A new pre-release version is available in nuget which targets .Net 4.5, .Net 4.6 and .Net Standard 1.6

## Usage

You can install the package from NuGet using `Install-Package ReverseMarkdown` or clone the repository and built it yourself. 

```csharp
var converter = new ReverseMarkdown.Converter();

string html = "This a sample <strong>paragraph</strong> from <a href=""http://test.com"">my site</a>";

string result = converter.Convert(html);

//result This a sample **paragraph** from [my site](http://test.com)
```

```csharp
// with config
string unknownTagsConverter = "pass_through";
bool githubFlavored = true;
var config = new ReverMarkdown.Config(unknownTagsConverter, githubFlavoured);
var converter = new ReverseMarkdown.Converter(config);
```
